This repository will soon provide access to the source code and pre-trained models for our traumatic brain injury image segmentation tool for 3D computed tomography scans.

An article describing our method and results is currently under review.

## Source code

The provided source code will enable training and testing our convolutional neural network designed for multi-class brain lesion segmentation in CT.

## Pre-trained model

We also make available a model that has been trained on a set of 184 annotated CT scans obtained from multiple clinical sites. This model has been validated on a set of 655 CT scans. Additionally, our model has been validated on an external, independent set of scans from 500 patients from the CQ500 dataset.
